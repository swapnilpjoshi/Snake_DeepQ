# AI learns to play Snake

In this project, I teach an AI (RL Agent) to play Snake! Everything is built from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch.
The model is trained using a Deep Q-Network with Epsilon Greedy Exploration.

## Further Scope
Transfer learning from pre-trained DQN for Puck World agent is used to improve performance and stability
